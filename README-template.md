## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://fonts.google.com/) - For fonts



### What I learned

I learnt a better way to use flexbox and it's properties. I also learnt about the div property better especially how to center it with ease.
Also i learnt how to use media queries better. 


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
}
```



### Continued development
-Flex box
-Media Queries
-Positioning i.e absolute, relative,fixed and static



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me for styling the text in the project. I really love it and wil keep using it for future projects
- [Example resource 2](https://ionic.io/ionicons) - This is an amazing article which helped me with the order icon. I'd recommend it to anyone finding a hard time looking for icons
